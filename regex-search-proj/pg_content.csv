Email - Overly Simple,"[a-zA-Z_]+?\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3}$",Simple email expression. Doesn't allow numbers in the domain name and doesn't allow for top level domains that are less than 2 or more than 3 letters (which is fine until they allow more). Doesn't handle multiple &quot;.&quot; in the domain ([emailÂ protected]).,regexlib.com/REDetails.aspx?regexp_id=16,Steven Smith
Pattern Title,"([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$",This expression matches email addresses and checks that they are of the proper form. It checks to ensure the top level domain is between 2 and 4 characters long but does not check the specific domain against a list (especially since there are so many of them now).,regexlib.com/REDetails.aspx?regexp_id=21,Steven Smith
Pattern Title,"^([a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+)@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.)|(([a-zA-Z0-9\-]+\.)+))([a-zA-Z]{2,4}|[0-9]{1,3})(\]?)$",Email validator that adheres directly to the specification for email address naming. It allows for everything from ipaddress and country-code domains to very rare characters in the username.,regexlib.com/REDetails.aspx?regexp_id=26,Andy Smith
Pattern Title,([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]+,Yet another simple email validator expression.,regexlib.com/REDetails.aspx?regexp_id=28,Steven Smith
Pattern Title,"^\w+[\w-\.]*\@\w+((-\w+)|(\w*))\.[a-z]{2,3}$",Email validation. With this short expression you can validate for proper email format. It's short and accurate.,regexlib.com/REDetails.aspx?regexp_id=35,Eric Lebetsamer
