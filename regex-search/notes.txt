This website will take a string from the user, ie. "password", "email address",
    "phone number" and more to find the regular expression for it. It will also
    allow user to test different string inputs right underneath to check to see
    it matches the regular expression.

Some things I will need:
    - wireframe for the webpage(s).
    - a python webscraping script that scrapes RegExLib and puts up to 5 regular
    expressions into a text file.
    - HTML and CSS scripts for a simple search page.
    - javascript for event handelings.
